# Fork of the mirrorrepo neo-layout
Since the website https://neo-layout.org holds precious, but only basic Info (including references to [the Web-Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20180410171629/http://wiki.neo-layout.org/)) and the proposed Infochannels there seem not to work, I decided to fork the code, so that at least one member of the neo2-users have a copy of the source.

## Infochannels
I found an active channel https://webchat.freenode.net/#neo (Link taken from the Web-archive)

## Next Steps
I still hope, that neo-layout.org will set up a appropriate Infosite and dev Community though.

I guess I do copy the content of the old "Benutzerhandbuch" and transfer it into markdown here...
